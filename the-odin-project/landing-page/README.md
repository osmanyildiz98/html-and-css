# odin-landing-page

I tried to design an eye-catching webpage using the flexbox features I learned in this project. Although it seemed complex at first, over time I understood where and how to use each properties. It was a project where I grappled with myself, went a bit crazy, but enjoyed it a lot. Hopefully, it will be enjoyable for those who review it as well :)
