# odin-recipes
In this project, I tried to explain the recipes I love to you.For this, I used the HTML tags that I had learned before in Odin Project.Working on this project was truly enjoyable for me.I hope that anyone who views my project will find enjoyment in it.

I tried to create a more visually appealing website using the CSS properties I recently learned.
